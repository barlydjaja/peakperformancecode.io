desc: 'Do we even need to comment our code?'

Have you ever wondered why did so many programmers write comment on their codebase? was it even necessary to go such lengths?

I would argue that the best code is to have no comments at all, but is this ideal  for us?

take a look at the simple code below

```ts
const a = 'albert'

const b = 'einstein'

const c = 'scientist'

function abc(a, b, c) {
  return a + " " + b + " is a " + c
}
```

just by reading the above statement we can already see that function `abc` is a powerful statement
