"We cannot force someone or something to come into our life", this is a lesson I learned the hard way. 
It is true that we can't make everyone likes us. Some will, some won't. Often, we need to accept the reality.

**It is what it is**

Often, we must let fate take it's course. In reality, there is no such thing as destiny or fate

**What's meant for us will come**

It can be a hard pill to swallow. But to learn to accept that things won't always go 
our way and many things are out of our control, is to learn life. You do not have the force
to make people follow what you want. The only thing we can do is to be sincere with our intention
and let fate take it's course. Their actions will show their genuine intentions and how important you are to them.

**Begging is unnecessary**

When it comes to people, communication is crucial, but you also need to know when to stop.
There is no need to explain more than necessary in order to be treated the way you expected.
Some will love, some will hate. Not because they don't understand, but because they refuse to.

**Whatever flows, flows. Whatever goes, let go.**

Remember, Whatever flows, flows. Whatever goes, let go. What comes, comes. 
What’s lost, let go. And what happens, accept. Better things come when you wait 
for what’s truly meant for you. Accepting things is better than forcing them. Never 
lose yourself trying to fit into someone else’s life.

**When the right time comes**

When the right time comes, you will meet the one true thing. The things that made your life worth living. 
The one true love, job, or relationship. May they bring you peace and happiness. Live life to the fullest.

**We all deserved to be happy**

**One life**. That's all there is for all of us. Make the best of it because we all
deserves to be happy in this one life. If you feel you haven't found the one true call,
be patient, universe might be working on bringing you together.
